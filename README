Annotations of vocal segments on different levels:


vocal_sections_anno: tab-separated file
	audio regions that correspond to sections from score with singing voice present. 
	fetched from sectionLinks in ``generate_voiced_sections`` from ``scripts/main.py`` and manually checked after that.

vocal_anno: tab-separated 
	audio regions with singing voice present. for singing voice detection. 
	TODO: create manually

vocal_onsets_anno: tab-separated
	timestamps for onsets of singing voice. 
	Done by intersecting manually annotated onsets with vocal_anno files with script ``generate_voiced_onsets`` in ``scripts/main.py``. Manually annotated onsets taken from https://github.com/MTG/otmm_audio_score_alignment_dataset/tree/vocal-only-annotation/  
	NOTE: if a syllable starts with unvoied sound, onsets is annotated at the beginning of the voiced part (e.g.  'Shi'  will have the onset beginning at i). However, if a background instrument plays same pitch simultaneously to voice, the onset of the instrument is marked as if it were the vocal onset. 

beats: 
	timestamps of beats (annotated only first 60 seconds)
